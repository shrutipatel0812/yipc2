                <p>"True success is not acing all your exams, working at the top notch companies, earnings millions of money but becoming a humble human who uses his power to bring smiles on the faces of the needy and one who contributes towards the making of a better society. I have always been actively participating in various activities apart from academics that taught me a great deal of skills and values that helped me achieve what I've achieved today, founding Youth India Foundation. My journey started from my school, Sai International where I got many opportunities like being the Cultural Secretary (Secondary) in the student council, being a member of the international press MUN, successfully planning and directing out school's biggest science fair SAITED working as the Finance Director and organising multiple events with mass footfall like Sai Abhinandan, MUN, Sai confluence etc - All these made it possible for me to learn to manage such a huge national team and making YIF. 
                    I thank everyone, all my dear friends and family that helped me accomplish so much and I look forward to doing more with all their love and support."
